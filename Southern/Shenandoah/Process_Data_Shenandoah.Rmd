Shenandoah Single vs Multi-pass Sampling
===========================================

Cleaning before entry into R:
* Replaced `,` with blank to read csv properly
* Replaced `'` and `"` with blank to avoid problems reading in text columns
* Replaced `ND` (No Data) with `NA` for missing data
* Changed `Species` to `Code` in the fish data headers to be able to merge with the species data (could do in R after import)

```{r setup, results = 'hide', message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

setwd('/Users/Dan/Documents/Research/Stream_Climate_Change/Brook_Trout_Data/Southern/Shenandoah/')

game <- fread("W_FI_Gamefish.csv", sep = ",")
sites <- fread("Southern_Site_Info.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
spp <- fread("Southern_Spp_Codes.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```
