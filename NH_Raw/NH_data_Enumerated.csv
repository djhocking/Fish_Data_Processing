This was more of an experimental year to determine effective methods to capture the species and locating where the species spawns along Pikes Point.  Three RW were captured in Fyke nets over several weeks and two RW were captured after a night long gill net set.  We learned the RW tend to utilize the southern end of the reef (just as the lake bottom becomes visible) is smaller substrate (golf ball size).  Lake trout tend to use larger substrate and often captured at the northern end of the Pikes Point reef.

43.1628,-70.965,2006,20060512,05/12/06,Oyster River,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Started EFISHing 200 upstream of Rte 4 Bridge to downstream side of culvert on Rt. 155A.  This is the widest part of the Oyster that weve looked for ABL so far.  Substrate   Mostly soft clay and sand with areas of compacted gravel.  LWD scattered throughout the reach.  Not really any rocks until approaching the 155A bridge. Sample area began upstream  of the Rt. 155 (Manchester Rd) bridge and ended at the first beaver dam (end point 43.1596 70.9658).  Water depths made sampling difficult.  Substrate   sand and rubble.  Similar to where we found ABL in upstream areas.   Potential reds were observed (pea size gravel (fist sized) surrounded by sand at the head of small riffles/woody debris.  Lower part of reach flooded by beavers.  Upper section mostly clay ledge and scattered boulders.  Small patches of sand.  Flows through mature forest.  FF nests observed

Mix of glides and riffles.  Upstream areas became less deep.  Substrate   mostly rubble with some sand and mud.  Areas of thick softwood canopy cover.  Sample site ended at confluence of Dube Brook (43.1651  70.9664).  Some potential areas for ABL were present but the species was not found.  Upstream of Snell Rd.  Because there was relatively high water on 5/12/06.  We checked a known location of ABL to see if they shifted habitats during deeper water.  We found ABL immediately in their typical habitat (in small shallow riffles or just slightly downstream).  This may help argue that ABLs are not present in the reaches sampled earlier in the day.  No mature ABL found.

This was the first night in a few days with suitable conditions for gill netting.  The air temp and high winds of the previous days allowed the water temperature to significantly drop.  Heavy winds were also predicted for a few days after this night.  Actually wind on 12/5/06 was a light from the SW shifting to NW at about 5mph.  19 of the RW were sampled in the southern most gill net during the first pull (about a 15 minute set).  Strong indication that the RW came onto the reef in a large school.  Nets removed by 1730h.  Final check of the fyke nets.  A strong confirmation that sampling RW with fyke nets is ineffective.

The undersized crossing on Kearsarge Rd created a large/deep pool that was too deep to survey.  Stream is very muddy/mucky and has a wetland floodplain that is very lush.  Stream is narrow but gets wider at bends.  Culvert may become perched during low flow conditions.  Stream substrate is very fine (gravel and sand).  Good riparian buffer in survey location (at least 100 on both sides of stream) between stream and nearby Hopkinton fairgrounds.

It is likely that a beaver dam recently blew out or was removed.  The survey site also had a smaller beaver dam (2 feet high).

The other tributary is much more smaller and may be seasonal during drought years.  Both streams were quickly checked for wild brook trout presence (above survey end point) and none where found only BND present.  Mink Brook Ln crossing consists of a large crushed pipe that has been recently repaired with a cement pad on the bottom.  This has created a perched outlet and no sediment or habitat features inside the crosssing.  Very shallow depth through crossing.  The stream has a good riparian buffer but an active logging operation has opened up some of the shading canopy in one location.  Stream doesnt really access floodplain (downcut overtime).  Surveyed pool below crossing (below survey site) and only found CWS and BND.  The liklihood of wild EBT recolonization is low because of the barriers along Siliver Brook.  There is an impounded section (Silver Pond) that was once a water supply and now a swimming/recreation area.  There are good examples of road drainage being directed well away from stream here (see photos).

Difficult to tell if stream is seasonal because of the rain from yesterday.  Channel splits into two smaller streams above survey location (above crossing).  Crossing consists of gathered rocks so vehichles can cross stream on the class VI road.  Most of the flow travels through a vortex between the rocks.  Signs of older logging along stream.  Stonewalls from historical agriculture observed.  Some mature trees still exist but much of the canopy is from younger trees (20-30 years old).  Stream looked suitable for wild EBT but not found.  Perhaps there is a barrier downstream that blocks recolonization.  The large amount of scour indicates the stream can be very flashy.

Stream flows into Stevens Brook <100m from survey location.  It is likely that wild brook trout found here are isolated from other populations.  This may be a good opportunity/project for students to learn about brook trout ecology and stream restoration (the need for riparian buffers road runoff thermal limitations etc.).  Survey conducted during record breaking air temps. Stretch below upper crossing at end of survey location was not electrofished in order to avoid harming the population in such warm air temps.

Very high gradient stream with large substrate.  Large boulders created pools.  All brook trout were found in pools.  The heavy use (worn down trails) around the stream makes it likely that the stream gets some fishing pressure.  Waterfall near confluence with the Warner River likely precludes fish passage.  Stream is likely very flashy during high flows (lots of bank scour and limited wood left in stream.  Landowners have cut a few trees very close to stream but canopy still provides almost 100% shade to stream.  Although the Rt. 103 crossing is perched the barrier should be a low priority for removal as the falls directly upstream preclude movement.

CWS and BND were found in culvert pool but not upstream in survey location.  This may indicate that the crossing is a barrier for some fish species.  It appears that a berm was created along the stream banks a long time ago.  This may have been constructed by the removal of rocks/boulders in the stream.  Cutting and logging roads in very close proximity to stream above survey location.  Lots of older junk (including cars) along streambank.  Overall a nice stream in this area could be improved by trash removal and buffer restoration.
