Are (or which) non-target species were consistently recorded (including 0 if not caught)?

Stream length sampled

Stream width (helpful not necessary): max flow bank width, wetted width?

Length measurements of each fish

Date of Survey

Site ID

Latitude (how measured)

Longitude (how measured)

One line per fish if length recorded

One line per species per pass per site-visit (per age-class if recorded) if lengths not recorded

Number of passes if lumped together (not ideal)

Time to complete the survey (or each pass)

Is it acceptable to share this data in aggregation with data from other states and agencies associated with scientific publication (some publishers now require data to be make publicly available unless legally prohibited due to privacy)
